      <p>A major goal of the HBP is to deliver a collaboratively built first draft "scaffold" model and simulation of the human brain by 2023. This will not be a complete simulation of every detail, but rather provide a framework for integrating data and knowledge related to the structure and function of the human brain from research and clinical studies around the world. The model and simulations will provide a community test bed for hypotheses and theories of brain function in health and disease. This scaffold model will therefore serve as the heart of a global collaboration to understand the brain.</p>

      <h2>A global collaboration to understand the brain</h2>
      <p>The Human Brain Project (HBP) is a European Commission Future and Emerging Technologies Flagship. Involving extensive collaboration, the HBP spans 24 countries and includes 112 partners across Europe and the world. The HBP aims to accelerate our understanding of the human brain, make advances in defining and diagnosing brain disorders, and develop new brain-like technologies.</p>

      <p>These Subprojects span strategic neuroscience data, cognitive architectures, theory, ethics and society, management and the development of six new informatics-based platforms including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href = "#SP5">Neuroinformatics - searchable atlases and analysis of brain data <span class="pill sp5" ></span></a></li>
        <li><a href = "#SP6">Brain Simulation - building and simulating multi-level models of brain circuits and functions <span class="pill sp6"></span></a></li>
